          <h2>Our Story:</h2>
          <p>The 6th Street General Baptist Church was organized on July 20, 1976 when the former pastor, Roger F. Lee Sr., purchased the property and building with the help of it's founding members. The church became a member of the Flat Creek Association of General Baptist in Petersburg, Indiana. </p>
          <p>When former pastor Roger F. Lee Sr. stepped down in the early 2000's, his son, Reverend Kenneth Lee stepped in and became the pastor of 6th Street General Baptist church. Kenny served the church faithfully until his passing in 2019, and his wife Judy Lee is still active in the church today.</p>
          <p>The church property and building, along with the house next door, was purchased on contract in December 2004 from the former pastor.</p>
          <p>In June of 2008, the church basement and house next door were flooded. Many members stepped in to help with remodeling the basement of the church. Later that same year, we decided to convert the house into an annex for church activities.</p>
          <p>In the early 2010's, Reverend Orville Turner, a minister within the church, was elected to be Assistant Pastor. He served faithfully in this role until his passing in 2019.</p>
          <p>In 2015, the church left Flat Creek Association and established its own association: the 6th Street General Baptist Association. All ministers and deacons are ordained/licensed under the new association. </p>
          <p>Shortly before Rev. Kenny's passing in 2019, former Pastor Don Hacker became the pastor of the church.</p>
          <p>When the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world in spring of 2020, we began recording and uploading Sunday morning sermons. We did this until restrictions on gatherings were lifted, and once lifted we began having limited services in person (while following all of the CDC recommended protocols for gatherings, until those were lifted as well) to keep our members safe. In 2022 after resuming our normal service schedule, we decided that instead of uploading recordings of our services to YouTube, we would instead begin live-streaming them on YouTube directly so that those who could not attend in person could join us live, virtually.</p>
          <p>After the passing of former Pastor Roger F. Lee Sr and the departure of Pastor Don Hacker in November and December 2022 respectively, a vote was held by the church near the beginning of 2023 and Reverend Robert Hensley was elected the pastor of 6th Street General Baptist Church.</p>
